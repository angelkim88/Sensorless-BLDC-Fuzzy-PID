# Sensorless-BLDC-Fuzzy-PID
We investigate the control problem of BLDC motor for robot arm.  The conventional controllers such as PID and Fuzzy may not be suitable for robot arm motor control because a load of motor is changed each time by various works of robot arm. To solve the problem, we propose a self-tuning PID by Fuzzy logic in this paper. We designed controller which consists of twenty five Fuzzy rules for self-tuning of each parameter of PID controller. The errors and error derivatives are used as the input variables of logic. Three outputs of the logic are used for the gains of PID controller. Defuzzifier employs a centroid method. The parameters of self-tuning PID controller are adjusted according to theses gains. We perform simulations for the Brushless DC motor model and controllers using a MATLAB/Simulink tool. The simulation results show that the self-tuning PID by Fuzzy logic has better performance compared to Zieger-Nichols PID and conventional Fuzzy controller. The self-tuning PID controller by Fuzzy logic gives slow rise-time, short settling-time, small overshoot and no steady state error.
